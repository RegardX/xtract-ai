This policy  applies  to all employees,  contractors,  consultants,  temporaries,  and other  workers  at 
CSC, including  any and all personnel  affiliated  with third  parties,  including  vendors.  This policy  
applies  to all equipment  that is owned  or leased  by CSC.  
 
Policy  
While  CSC's  ITS Department  desires  to provide  a reasonable  level  of freedom  and privacy,  users  
should be  aware  that all CSC‐owned  equipment,  network  infrastructure,  and software  
applications  are the property  of CSC  and therefore  are to be used  for official  use only.  Also,  all data  
residing  on CSC‐owned equipment  is also the property  CSC  and therefore,  should  be treated  as 
such,  and protected  from unauthorized  access.  
 
The following  activities  provide  a general  roadmap  to use 
  technology  resources  in an 
acceptable manner:  
 All passwords  used  to access  CSC  systems  must  be kept  secure  and protected  
from unauthorized  use. 
 No user account  can be shared  between  individuals.  Authorized  users  are responsible  
for the security  of their  own passwords  and accounts.  
 Do not transfer  personally  identifiable  information  on portable  equipment  and 
storage devices.   
 
 Public  postings  by employees  from  a CSC  email  address  should  contain  the 
following disclaimer  stating  that the opinions  expressed  are strictly  their own and not 
necessarily those  of CSC,  unless  the posting  is in the course  of business  duties:  
o Any views  or opinions  presented  in this message  are solely  those  of the author  and 
do not necessarily  represent  those  of Connors  State  College.  Employees  of Connors  
State College  are expressly  required  not to make  defamatory  statements  and not 
to infringe or authorize  any infringement  of copyright  or any other  legal  right  by 
electronic communications.  Any such  communication  is contrary  to CSC  policy  
and outside  the scope  of the employment  of the individual  concerned.  CSC  will not 
accept  any liability  in respect  of such  communication,  and the employee  responsible  
will be personally  liable for any damages  or other  liability  arising.  
 All computers  residing  on the internal  CSC  network,  whether  owned  by the employee  or 
CSC,  shall  be continually  executing  approved  virus‐scanning  software  with a current,  
up‐to‐ date virus  database.  
 Employees  must  use extreme  caution  when  opening  e‐mail attachments  received  
from unknown  senders.  
 Personally  identifiable  information  cannot  be sent via electronic  means  and should  
be transferred  within  the internal  network  or through  secure  VPN connections.  
 Off‐campus  work  should  be completed  via a secure  VPN connection  so that no 
data  is transferred  off‐network.  
 All workstations  should  be kept  secure.  Users  should  lock the workstation  when  not attended  
to protect  unauthorized  users  from  accessing  secure  files. 
The following  activities  are, in general,  prohibited.  Employees  may be exempted  from  these  
restrictions during  the course  of their legitimate  job responsibilities  (e.g.,  systems  administration  staff  
may have  a need  to disable  the network  access  of a host if that host is disrupting  production  
services).  
 
Under  no circumstances  is an employee  of CSC  authorized  to engage  in any activity  that is illegal  
under local,  state,  federal  or international  law while  utilizing  CSC‐owned  resources.  
 
The lists below  are by no means  exhaustive,  but attempt  to provide  a framework  for activities  which  fall 
into the category  of unacceptable  use. 
 
The following activities are strictly prohibited, with no exceptions:  
 
 Violations  of the rights  of any person  or company  protected  by copyright,  trade  secret,  
patent  or other  intellectual  property,  or similar laws  or regulations,  including,  but not limited  
to, the installation  or distribution  of ""pirated""  or other  software  products  that are not 
appropriately licensed  for use by CSC.

distribution  of photographs  from  magazines,  books  or other  copyrighted  sources,  
copyrighted music,  and the installation  of any copyrighted  software  for which  CSC  or the 
end user does  not have  an active  license  is strictly  prohibited.   
 
 Exporting  software,  technical  information,  encryption  software  or technology,  in violation  of 
international  or regional  export  control  laws,  is illegal.  The appropriate  management  should  
be consulted  prior  to export  of any material  that is in question.  
 Introduction  of malicious  programs  into the network  or server  environments  (e.g.,  viruses, 
worms,  Trojan  horses,  rootkits,  etc.).  
 Revealing  your account  password  to others  or allowing  use of your account  by others.  
This includes  family  and other  household  members  when  work  is being  done  at

hosted by CSC  or connected  via CSC's  network.  ",Alice Johnson
1,Policy,Accessibility Policy," 
 
Overview  
This policy  establishes  the accessibility  guidelines  for all CSC‐owned  technology  resources.  The 
purpose of this policy  is to ensure  that every  CSC  student  is presented  with an equal  opportunity  
to learn  and that all employees  can adequately  use the required  technology  equipment  for the 
purpose  of their required  occupation.  These  requirements  must  be met where  any learning  
impairment  exists  for any CSC  student  or work  limitation  exists  for any CSC  employee.  These  types  
of accessibility  requirements may  include,  but are not limited  to, the following  applications  or 
devices:  
 Screen reading  software  
 Screen magnification  software  
 Stereo  headsets  or other  sound  devices  
 
This policy  applies  to all CSC‐owned  technology  resources  in labs and other  learning  areas  for 
student use and in departmental  or teaching  areas  for employee  use. 
 
Policy  
A reasonable  attempt  shall  be made  at all times  to address  the needs  of our students  and 
employees, particularly  when  those  needs  are due to an accessibility  issue  presented  by a physical  
impairment  or learning  disability  of some  kind.  The CSC  ITS Department  shall  make  every  effort  to 
ensure  that each  and every  student  is presented  with an equal  or comparable  learning  environment  
regardless  of the hurdle they may  face.  
 
The CSC  ITS Department  will always  strive  to offer  technology  solutions  that help improve  the 
learning environments  for all students  but will be particularl y diligent  in ensuring  that no student  will 
be unable to  learn  within  a classroom  due to a physical  impairment  or learning  disability  of some  
kind.  The same will  be provided  for any employee  requiring  accommodation  due to a physical  
impairment  or learning disability  of any kind.  
 
Please  note  that advance  notice  of these  needs  is required  and may change  due to the request.  
For instance,  additional  software  needs  will take  some  time to produce  an order  and install  the 
software  so it will be unreasonable  to expect  a request  such  as this to have  an immediate  
turnaround  time.  
 
Casting  aside  the general  expectations  above,  the CSC  ITS Department  cannot  be held liable  for 
issues surrounding  software  application  issues,  hardware  failures,  or the inability  of employees  or 
students  to convey  their respective  needs  in a reasonable  amount  of time to allow  such  software  or 
hardware  to be properly  installed.  
 
With  that said,  the CSC  ITS Department  will continually  strive  to ensure  that all learning  environments 
have  the necessary  technology  and are adequately  structured  in a way to provide  the most  
conducive learning  environment  possible,  regardless  if a learning  disability  or physical  impairment  may 
be present for any student.  The CSC  ITS Department  will also ensure  that all employee  areas  are 
adequately designed  to facilitate  a productive  working  environment  as well. ",Bob Smith
2,Policy,Auditing Policy,"  
 
Overview  
This policy  addresses  third‐party  entities  and their  ability  to conduct  an internal  technology  audit. 
This type  of audit  is basically  a 
‐test
  on our technology  resources  to evaluate  the level  of 
security  our technology  systems  present  as well as the level  of scrutiny  it can withstand.  
 
Vulnerabilities  are a primary  focus  for the CSC  ITS Department.  Seeking  these  vulnerabilities  out 
before  they develop  into potential  problems  is best  for CSC,  its resources,  employees,  associates, 
and students.  To accomplish  this, internal  audits  are necessary  to periodically  determine  what 
vulnerabilities  may exist  within  
  technology  resources.  
 
The purpose  of this agreement  is to set forth  a policy  regarding  network  security  scanning  offered  
by a third‐party  audit  group  to CSC.  The CSC  ITS Department  shall  allow  the utilization  of various  
methods (both  hardware  and software)  to perform  electronic  scans  of our networks,  firewalls,  
and other hardware  devices  located  at CSC.  
 
Audits may be conducted to:  
 Ensure  integrity,  confidentiality  and availability  of information  and resources  
 Investigate  possible  security  incidents  to ensure  conformance  to the established  
CSC  ITS 
  policies  
 Monitor  user or system  activity  where  appropriate  
Policy  
This policy  cover s all computers,  equipment,  and communication  devices  owned  or operated  by 
CSC. This  policy  also covers  any computers,  equipment,  and communications  devices  that are 
present  on CSC premises,  but which  may not be owned  or operated  by Connors  State  College.  
The third‐party  audit group  will not perform  Denial  of Service  activities  at any time  during  an 
audit.  
 
When  requested,  and for the purpose  of performing  an audit,  consent  for the access  required  to 
perform  the scan  will be provided  to members  of the third‐party  audit  group  by the CSC  ITS 
Department. The  CSC  ITS Department  hereby  provides  its consent  to allow  the third‐party  audit  
group  to access  its networks, firewalls, and other hardware devices to the extent necessary to 
perform the scans authorized  in this agreement.  The CSC  ITS Department  shall  provide  protocols,  
addressing  information, and network  connections  sufficient  for the third‐party  audit  group  to 
perform  network  scanning.  
 
The access involved in the scan may include:  
 
 User level  and/or  system  level  access  to any computing,  networking  equipment,  
and communications  devices  
 Access  to information  (electronic,  hardcopy,  etc.) that may be produc ed, transmitted,  or 
stored on CSC  equipment  and/or  premises  
 Access  to work  areas  (labs,  offices,  cubicles,  storage  areas,  etc.) 
 Access  to interactively  monitor  and log traffic  on CSC  networks    
 
Since  CSC  gains  access  to certain  resources  from  third‐party  entities,  cooperation  from  these  
resources may  be required  to perform  a full network  scan.  For instance,  OneNet  provides  the Internet  
connections to the CSC  networks.  Because  of this, a comprehensive  network  scan  may require  
the assistance  of OneNet  or other  third‐party  service  providers  should  part of the scanning  activities  
originate  outside  the CSC  network.  
 
Network  performance  and/or  availability  may  be affected  by the network  scanning.  The CSC  ITS 
Department  releases  any third‐party  audit  group  of any and all liability  for damages  that may arise  
from network  availability  restrictions  caused  by the network  scanning,  unless  such  damages  are the 
result  of the third‐party  audit  
  gross  negligence  or intentional  misconduct.  
 
The CSC  ITS Department  shall  identify,  in writing,  a person  to be available  should  the third‐party  have 
questions  regarding  data  discovered  or should  the third‐party  require  assistance.  
 
CSC  and the third‐party  audit  group  shall  identify,  in writing,  the allowable  dates  for the audit 
vulnerability  scan  to take  place.  Permission  to conduct  a vulnerability  scan  will be obtained  from  
the Director  of IT Systems,  the President,  or a designee  a minimum  of 48 hours  prior  to the test. ",Charlie Brown
3,Policy,Backup Policy,"
 
Overview  
The CSC  IT Systems  Department  maintains  systems  to hold  and retain  all essential  data  for each 
individual  department.  This storage  area,  or group  drive  as it is referred  to, is used  to securely  store  all 
data for any given department. Because of this centralized storage arrangement, the CSC 
ITS Department  is able  to offer  secure  backup  capability  ensuring  all data  will be accessible  in the 
event  of a disaster  or other  event  in which  the data  would  be destr oyed.  
 
This policy  establishes  regular  backup  schedules  for our group  drive  storage  devices  and pertains  to 
all this  data.  With  that said,  this does  not pertain  to individual,  departmental,  or computer  lab 
devices, mobile  devices,  or other  portable  storage  medium  where  the data  resides  locally  on the 
device  or medium.  The CSC  ITS Department  does  not guarantee  backup  for any of these  types  of 
devices  or storage  medium.  
 
Policy  
Every  effort  shall  be made  by the individual  departments  and employees  at CSC  to store  
sensitive, important,  and confidential  data  on their respective  group  drive.  As mentioned  
above,  the CSC  ITS Department  cannot  be held liable  for issues  with data  stored  
elsewhere.  
 
Regular  backup  schedules  are in place  within  the group  drive  storage  device  to ensure  that 
backups occur  at regular  intervals  and over a time span  to provide  ample  opportunity  for the CSC  
ITS Department to  recover  a file, folder,  or group  of such.  It should  be noted  that the CSC  ITS 
Department  does  require immediate  notification  in the event  a file, folder,  or collection  of either  is 
found  to be missing,  corrupt, or otherwise damaged. Waiting to inform the CSC ITS 
Department decreases the probability of successful  recovery.  
 
Specific  information  regarding  backup  restoration  on an institution  scale  can be found  in the CSC  
 Disaster  Recovery  Plan (DRP ) or the associated  Backup  Priority  List (BPL).  These  
deal  with catastrophic  recovery  needs  that affect  multiple  departments  or the institution  as a 
whole.  
 
The hardware  that the CSC  ITS Department  uses  consists  of two Dell EqualLogic  storage  devices. 
One device  is placed  in the server  area  of the ITS Department  on the Warner  Campus  to serve  as a 
primary storage  and backup  device  while  the other  is placed  in the server  area  of the ITS Department  
on the Muskogee  Port Campus  to serve  as an off‐site backup  and replication  device.  
 
The primary  device  in Warner  holds  all data  and backups  and serves  as the primary  device  for file 
access and  immediate  backup.  The secondary,  off‐site device  in Muskogee  replicates  all data  from 
the Warner device  to create  a stable  off‐site copy  of the data  and backups  present  on the 
Warner  device.  
 
For this document, considering the type of hardware described above, normal backups do 
not necessarily  retain  the same  meaning  as when  used  in conjunction  with other  hardware  devices.  
Because of this, the following  descriptions  are provided,  based  on the current  hardware  being  
used,  so as to better  understand  the overall  backup  process.    
 
• Backups:  These  refer  to snapshots  taken  of the file structure  and database. These  snapshots  
are essentially  pointers  to changes  occurring  within  the storage  device  since  the last 
scheduled snapshot.  This greatly  reduces  the file storage  requirements  necessary  to hold 
backups  while  still providing  the same  or superior  level  of backup  capability  found  in other  
devices.  
 
• Replication:  This refers  to the copying  process  of all data  and associated  backups  from  the 
primary backup  device  in Warner  to the secondary  backup  device  in Muskogee.  During  a 
replication,  all data and  backups  are replicated  so that a mirror  copy  is retained  at the 
Muskogee  location  for off‐site, backup  capability  should  a disaster  or other  issues  occur.  
 
Regularly  scheduled  backups  and replications  shall  be performed  by the CSC  ITS Department  using  
the following  schedule:  
 
Hourly Backups  
 7:00 a.m. 
 10:00  p.m. 
 Every  day,  every  hour  as noted  herein,  on the hour  
 
Weekly Backups  
 10:30  p.m. 
 Every  Friday  
 
Monthly Backups  
 11:59 p.m. 
 Last day of each  calendar  month  
 
Mid‐Yearly backups  
 12:30  a.m. 
 July 1 
 
Yearly backups  
 12:30  a.m. 
 January  1 
 
Daily Replication  
 12:01  a.m. 
 All data  is replicated  from  the Warner  Campus  to the Muskogee  Campus.  
 
At the beginning  of each  day, beginning  at 7:00 a.m.,  backups  will begin  and continue  each  hour,  on 
the hour,  until 10:00  p.m. each  evening.  
 
Every  Friday  at 10:30  p.m.,  after  the last hourly  backup  for that day, a weekly  backup  will be completed.  
 
At the end of each  month,  on the last day of the month,  a monthly  backup  will be completed  at 11:59 
p.m. 
 
On July 1 of each year, at 12:30 a.m., a mid ‐yearly backup will be completed.    
 
On January 1 of each year, at 12:30 a.m., a yearly backup will be completed.  
 
At 12:01 a.m. every  morning,  all backups  and data  will be replicated  from  Warner  to Muskogee  for off‐ 
site storage  and secondary  backup.  
 
All backups  are clearly  labeled  so as to distinguish  one from  another  easily.  At minimum,  the following 
information  is provided  for each  backup  file: 
 
• Time  (CST)  
 e.g. 12:00:00  AM or 12:34:59  PM 
• Date  
 e.g. 12/31/10  or 2/29/12  
• Backup  Type  
 e.g. Hourly  or End of Year  
 
Testing  for data  integrity  will be performed  at regularly  scheduled  intervals  by the backup  hardware  
but may  also be performed  manually  at random  times  to verify  the validity,  accuracy,  and 
authenticity  of the backup.  These  random  tests  should  total  no less than  six per year  and it is 
recommended  that these tests  fall approximately  two months  apart,  less if more  than  the 
minimum  number  of tests  are used.  
 
We encourage  that backup  tests  be taken  within  one week  of the completion  of the yearly  and mid‐ 
yearly  backups  with the remaining  backups  spaced  throughout  the remaining  months  of the year.  If 
six are used,  it should  follow  this testing  schedule:  
 
• Test 1 
 January  1‐7 
• Test 2 
 March  1‐7 
• Test 3 
 May 1‐7 
• Test 4 
 July 1‐7 
• Test 5 
 September  1‐7 
• Test 6 
 November  1‐7 
 
If more  than  six tests  are used,  then  the schedule  may  be set at the discretion  of the CSC  ITS 
Department,  however,  two of the tests  must  occur  no later  than  one week  after  the yearly  and mid‐ 
yearly  backups  are completed.  
 
Testing  shall  consist  of one or more  of the following  methods  of data  validation  and verification  of 
accuracy and  authenticity:  
 
• Random  Dummy  File Restoration:  Six to twelve  dummy  files are inserted  on the file server  at 
random  locations.  Afterwards,  we will intentionally  delete  these  dummy  files. Then,  recovery 
will be tested  to verify  data  is being  restored  properly.  If this verifies  the data  is being  
restored properly,  the test is completed  and the dummy  file may  be removed.  
• Random  Actual  File Restoration:  Recovery  of a six to twelve  actual  random  files located  on 
the server.  Comparisons  will then  be made  with current  versions  of the same  files to verify  
content and  accuracy  of restoration  process.  If the comparisons  verify  that the recovery  was 
successful, then  the test is completed.  
• Random  File Location  Verification:  Movement  of a single  dummy  file to various  locations  on 
the file  server.  Initially  the file is inserted  onto  the file server  and backups  are tested  to verify  
the file  exists  in backups  at the initial  location.  If this is confirmed,  then  the file is moved  on the 
file server  to a second  location  and backups  are tested  yet again  to verify  that the file is in 
the   
 
second  location. Once  this is confirmed,  the file is moved  for a third  time and backups  are once 
again  tested  to verify  the file exists  in the new location.  If this is confirmed  then  the test is 
completed  and the dummy  file may be removed.  Backups  are working  correctly  and file 
contents  and locations  are being  updated  appropriately.  
• Miscellaneous:  Other  tests  may be used  at the discretion  of the CSC  ITS Department  with 
only one  restriction:  they may not interfere  with access  or otherwise  cause  any data  loss on 
the file server.  
 
All restoration processes will follow, at minimum, one of the following methods:  
 
• Re‐routing  primary  traffic  from  backup  and storage  device  in Warner  to accompanying  
device  in Muskogee or  vice‐versa  
• Physically  transporting  one device  to another  location  
• Copying  all files or a subset  of files from  the backup  equipment  to the file server  
• Via the testing  process  described  in this document  
• Utilizing  the CSC  ITS 
  Disaster  Recovery  Plan 
• Utilizing  the CSC  ITS 
  Backup  Priority  List 
• Other  methods,  approved  by the CSC  ITS Department,  that do not interfere  with 
access  or otherwise  cause  any data  loss on the file server  
 
If it is found  that a scheduled  backup  process  is incomplete  or missing  due to a hardware  or 
software malfunction,  then  the backup  will be completed  as soon  as possible  and a hardware  test 
will be needed to verify  no long‐term  problems  exist  that may affect  backups  in the future.  Should  
a hardware  test yield  results  that indicate  serious  issues,  then  a replacement  for the faulty  hardware  
should  be found  as soon  as possible  in order  to prevent  such  issues  from  occurring  in the future.  
 
If these  issues  prevent  backups  from  occurring,  then  the off‐site backup  device  in Muskogee  will be 
transferred  to primary  backup  duties  and a secondary  device  should  be purchased  and then  placed  
at Warner  to regain  primary  functionality.  
 
The following  is the maximum  number  of backups  and replications  that the CSC  ITS Department  will 
retain  at any one time.  Once  these  backups  or replications  reach  the maximum  count,  the oldest  will be 
recycled  so that the newest  may  be retained.  
 
• Hourly  Backup  
o Copies  on file: 16 per day,  112 total  
o 7 days  worth  of data  at hourly  intervals  
 
• Weekly  Backup  
o Copies  on file: 12 total  
o 12 weeks  (approx.  3 months)  worth  of data  at weekly  intervals  
 
• Monthly  Backup  
o Copies  on file: 3 per month,  36 total  
o 36 months  (approx.  3 years)  worth  of data  at monthly  intervals  
 
• Mid‐Yearly  Backup    
 
o Copies  on file: 3 total  
o 3 years  worth  of data  at yearly  (mid‐year)  intervals  
 
• Yearly  Backup  
o Copies  on file: 3 total  
o 3 years  worth  of data  at yearly  (end‐of‐year)  intervals  
 
• Daily  Replication  
o Copies  on file: 32 total  
o 32 days  worth  of exact  copies  of existing  data  and backups  replicated  off‐site in 
daily intervals  
 
Online  log files are retained  consisting  of information  for each  backup  or replication  process, 
hardware/software  errors,  access  issues,  or other  critical  errors  involving  the backup  hardware.  
These entries  are also emailed  to the CSC  Backup  email  account  for verification  and 
notification.  ",David Williams
4,Policy,Data Retention Policy,"
Overview  
This policy  will determine  how long data  shall  be retained  under  the guidelines  of federal  and state  law 
and within  institutional  policies  as dictated  herein.  
 
Policy  
All data  shall  be retained,  at minimum,  the time frame  as specified  in any current,  standing  federal  or 
state  law. No data  residing  within  any CSC  facility  or technology  equipment  will knowingly  be 
destroyed prior  to this timeframe  unless  such  laws  are modified  to reflect  a new time  frame.  If such  
changes  do occur,  the new timeframe  will be susceptible  to the new law and all data  will be retained  
within  the new specifications.  
 
Under  no circumstances  is data  to be removed,  discarded,  disposed  of, or otherwise  destroyed  that 
will compromise  legal  compliance,  data  integrity,  or institutional  needs.  The CSC  ITS Department  shall  
make every  effort  to extend  the data  retention  timeframes  of all data  as long as the institution  requires  
access without  compromising  any legal  statues  set forth  regarding  storage  or destruction  of such  
data.  No data will be destroyed  prior  to or retained  longer  than  any legal  requirement  dictates.  
 
The CSC  ITS Department  will continually  utilize  backup  equipment,  secondary ‐site storage,  and 
regular backup  schedules  to ensure  that critical  data  is retained  and kept  from  corruption  or other  
types  of data loss.  Every  effort  shall  be made  to ensure  the institutional  data  needs  are given  top 
priority  in the event of a loss of data,  corruption  of data,  or if data  recovery  is necessary.  
 
This policy  shall  never  decrease  the retention  time under  any state  or federal  law but may only increase 
the retention  timeframe  required  by the institution.  This increase  may only be applicable  as long as it 
does  not compromise  the integrity,  storage  capability,  or otherwise  degrade  the overall  storage 
capability  of the system  being  used.  ",Eva Jones
5,Policy,Electronic Communications Policy," 
Overview  
Electronic  communication  is necessary  to fulfill multiple  roles  and activities  here at CSC.  Because  of the 
varying  types  of electronic  communication,  we will focus  on those  used  primarily  here  at CSC:  
• Email  
• VoIP  
• Videoconferencing  
• Digital  Signage  
 
Email  is the official  method  of communication  at CSC,  both  for students  and employees.  Business  is 
conducted  every  day via email.  Since  email  has both  positive  and negative  connotations,  it is 
imperative that  we recognize  that the positive  aspects  greatly  outweigh  the negative  aspects.  
However,  we must also realize  that the negative  aspects  exist  and ensure  that this method  of 
communication  is used effectively,  efficiently,  and for 
 intended  purpose.  
 
 VoIP phone  system  is used  to transmit  and receive  audio/video  within  the institution  to 
facilitate direct  communication  amongst  employees  and departments.  It is also used  to transmit  
and receive audio  outside  the institution  to facilitate  direct  communication  with vendors,  
students,  other institutions,  and other  third‐party  entities.  Because  of this capability,  we must  ensure  
that it is used  for work  purposes.  
 
Videoconferencing  equipment  is used  primarily  for instructional  classrooms  requiring  connectivity  to 
other  CSC  locations  and to local  area  high schools.  Videoconferencing  equipment  is also used  to 
facilitate  conferences  and meetings  with other  institutions,  state  agencies,  or other  third‐party  entities. 
Since  this type  of communication  conveys  not only audio,  but video  as well, it is particularly  important 
for it to be used  for its intended  purposes.  
 
Digital  signage  is used  on campus  to convey  student  activities,  important  academic  dates,  
campus events,  and other  information  to students,  employees,  and visitors.  Since  this is also a 
visual  and auditory  communication  mechanism,  it is also important  to ensure  it is used  for its intended  
purpose  as well. 
 
Policy  
Regardless  of the type  of technology  being  used,  electronic  communication  is meant  to serve  the 
needs of  the college  by sharing  information  with students,  employees,  vendors,  other  state  agencies,  
campus visitors,  and other  individuals.  Because  of the unique  capabilities  of each  system  it is 
important  to realize that  each  type  of communication  method  contains  unique  issues  that must  be 
addressed  on a case‐by‐ case  basis;  however,  general  rules  can be set forth  to ensure  that any 
communication  method  is used wisely  and according  to its intended  purpose.  
 
In general,  
  electronic  communication  mechanisms  are to be used  to share  information  with 
students,  employees,  vendors,  other  state  agencies,  campus  visitors,  and other  individuals.    
 
It is also important  to note  that the true definition  of information  sharing  at CSC  is to adequately  
convey the  appropriate  knowledge  so that the College  mission  is not hindered  but enhanced.  This 
information  is always  to be distributed  under  the following  assumptions:  
 
 
 
• 
  always  understood  to represent  an official  statement  from  the institution.  
• 
  never  be used  for the creation  or distribution  of any information  that meets  the 
following criteria : 
o Disruptive  
o Offensive  
o Derogatory  
o Specific  comments  about  race,  gender,  hair color,  disabilities,  age, sexual  
orientation, pornography,  religious  beliefs  and practice,  political  beliefs,  or 
national  origin.  
o Any information  that could  be used  to sabotage  institutional  progress  
o Any personally  identifiable  information  
• 
  not be used  for personal  gain  
• 
  not be used  extensively  for personal  use 
• 
  not be used  to distribute  malicious  or harmful  software  or information.  ",Frank Miller
6,Policy,Emergency Notification Policy,"Overview  
CSC  maintains  an emergency  notification  system  that is used  to notify  students  and employees  who 
have  opted  in to the service  via the C‐Key website.  This system  is updated  daily  to reflect  the current 
student  data  available  so that any notification  message  will be delivered  to the required  student  and 
employee  list. 
 
Policy  
The CSC  Emergency  Notification  System  is to be used,  at all times,  for emergency  purposes  or 
purposes deemed  necessary  by the President  or designee  only.  The notification  system  is to be 
used  to send messages  via text to email  addresses  and mobile  phones,  via voice  to office  phones,  
personal  phones, and mobile  devices,  and via applications  to desktops  and office  phones.  
 
At no time shall  this system  be used  for normal  messaging,  notifications,  or otherwise  standard  
contact as  this would  compromise  the importance  of these  messages  and may create  an 
environment  where students  and employees  are able  to overlook  these  types  of messages  
because  of the frequency  with which  they  could  occur.  
 
With  that said,  tests  of this system  shall  be conducted  once  a semester  at minimum  to ensure  the 
system  is functioning  properly.  Additional  tests  may be conducted  but are not required;  however,  more 
than  four tests  per semester  may be too many  to retain  the importance  of such  messages  when  an 
actual  emergency  arises  requiring  the system  to be operational.  
 
Only  users  defined  below  shall  be able  to send  emergency  notification  messages  via this system:  
 
 Director  of IT Systems  
 Director  of College  and Community  Relations  
 Director  of Campus  Life 
 Muskogee Campus  Administrators  
 Vice President  for Academic  Affairs  
 Other  designee  deemed  necessary  by the President  ",Grace Davis
7,Policy,Encryption Policy," 
Overview  
The purpose  of this policy  is to provide  guidance  that limits  the use of encryption  to those 
algorithms  that have  received  substantial  public  review  and have  been  proven  to work  effectively. 
Additionally,  this policy  provides  direction  to ensure  that Federal  regulations  are followed,  and 
legal authority  is granted  for the dissemination  and use of encryption  technologies  outside  of the 
United States.  
 
While  CSC  employees  do not typically  use encryption  methods  to a great  extent,  it is wise to follow 
the policy  below  if encryption  of information  is necessary  on any device  residing  on campus.  
 
Policy  
A proven,  standard  algorithm  such  as Advanced  Encryption  Standard  (AES)  should  be used  as 
the basis  for encryption  technologies.  This algorithm  represents  the actual  cipher  used  for an 
approved application.  
 
Additionally,  the NSA mentions  that AES encryption  with 128‐bit keys provides  adequate  
protection for  classified  information  up to the SECRET  level  so this should  be the minimum  level  
utilized  by any encryption  tool. Similarly,  Ephemeral  Unified  Model  and the One‐Pass  Diffie  
Hellman  (ECDH)  and the  Elliptic  Curve  Digital  Signature  Algorithm  (ECDSA)  using  the 256‐bit prime  
modulus  elliptic  curve as  specified  in FIPS PUB 186‐3 and SHA‐256 provide  adequate  protection  
for classified  information up  to the SECRET  level.  During  the transition  to the use of elliptic  curve  
cryptography  in ECDH  and ECDSA,  DH, DSA and RSA can be used  with a 2048‐bit modulus  to 
protect  classified  information  up to the SECRET  level.  
 
The use of proprietary  encryption  algorithms  is not allowed  for any purpose,  unless  reviewed  by 
qualified  experts  outside  of the vendor  in question  and approved  by the CSC  ITS Department.  
Be aware  that the export  of encryption  technologies  is restricted  by the U.S. Government.  
Residents  of countries  other  than  the United  States  should  make  themselves  aware  of the 
encryption  technology laws  of the country  in which  they  reside.  
 
Recent  developments  in the field of encryption  have  indicated  that it is possible  for an encryption 
key to stay resident  in volatile  memory  long enough  after  shutdown  for it to be stolen  and used  
to break  the encryption  protecting  the associated  PC. Because  of this, even  though  the use 
of encryption  is recommended,  specific  rules  are required  in order  to protect  the encryption  
and, therefore,  the data  on the drive.  
 
 Never  leave  any PC unattended  that contains  confidential  CSC  data  or a method  to 
access confidential CSC  data.  
 If you must  leave  a PC unattended  that contains  confidential  information  (i.e. in an 
open office  or a conference  room),  only do so if proper  encryption  has been  enabled  
and the PC has been  powered  off for no less than  5 minutes.  
 Never  authenticate  the encryption  on a PC which  contains  confidential  CSC  data  
or a method  to access  confidential  CSC  data  and leave  it unattended,  allow  a 
non‐CSC  user to utilize  the device,  or permit  the device  to be copied  in any way.    
 
 Never  disable  or bypass  the encryption  on a PC which  contains  confidential  CSC  data  
or a method  to access  confidential  CSC  data.  
 
If any user is unsure  of the appropriate  encryption  standard  to use or if encryption  is necessary,  
he/she may  take  advantage  of 
  open‐door  policy  and request  assistance  and information  
regarding  these encryption  standards  and how to encrypt  his/her  data  to secure  it 
appropriately.  ",Hannah Garcia
8,Policy,Enforcement Policy,"
 
Overview  
This policy  is to establish  enforcement  guidelines  to ensure  that all CSC  ITS Department  policies  and 
procedures  are adhered  to and observed  by all departments  and individuals  at CSC  including  
students, employees,  visitors,  vendors,  etc. Anyone  using  technology  resources  at CSC  will be 
required  to operate within  the parameters  described  in this document  or the following  
enforcement  options  may  be administered.  
 
Policy  
All policies herein are applicable to any and all users of technology resources at CSC.  
 
If it is found  that any individual,  department,  or external  entity  disobeys  the policies  and procedures  
set forth  within  this document,  whether  knowingly  or unknowingly,  then  the enforcement  of such  
policy may include,  but may  not be limited  to: 
 Forced  compliance  with the policy  
 Disciplinary  action  including  termination  of employment,  if an employee  
 Disciplinary  action  including  expulsion  from  the College,  if a student  
 Termination  of vendor  contract  and or service  agreement  
 Prosecution  to the fullest  extent  of the law ",Isaac Rodriguez
9,Policy,Equipment Configuration Policy,"Overview  
This policy  has been  established  to create  a standard  configuration  for all technology  resources  at 
CSC. Because  of the variances  between  the types,  makes,  models,  configurations,  builds,  versions,  
and brands of  technology  resources  available,  it is necessary  to standardize  all technology  resources  
to make  service and maintenance  easier  and also to help keep  costs  down.  
 
Policy  
All employees  shall  order  and utilize  equipment  that is serviceable  and recommended  by the CSC  ITS 
Department.  Since  equipment  availability  changes  over time,  especially  when  referring  to technology,  a 
comprehensive  list indicating  appropriate  hardware  would  be virtually  impossible  to create.  Because  
of this,  any individual  or department  wishing  to purchase  technology  equipment  should  first consult  a 
CSC ITS Department  personnel  member  for current  specifications  for any given  piece  of 
equipment.  
 
This applies to any and all technology equipment including, but not limited to:  
 
 Computers  (Servers,  Desktop,  Laptop,  Tablets  and Mobile  Devices,  etc.) 
 HDTVs  
 Printers , scanners,  copiers,  fax machines,  or all‐in‐one devices  
 Projectors,  screens,  and SmartBoards  
 VoIP  phones  
 Digital  cameras  and camcorders  
 Software  (Application,  Operating  System,  Network ‐Based,  etc.) 
 Other  technology  equipment  not specifically  mentioned  here  
 
For more  details  on procedures  required  to place  an order  for technology  equipment,  please  see the 
Equipment  Ordering  Procedures  included  in this document  for detailed  instructions.  ",Jack Martinez
10,Policy,Guest/Visitor Access and Technology Use Policy," 
Overview  
CSC  maintains  an atmosphere  that is open  and allows  guests  and visitors  access  to resources,  as 
long as such  access  does  not compromise  the integrity  of the systems  or information  contained  
within  the campus  and does  not introduce  malicious  software  or intent  to the internal  network.  
 
Policy  
Guest and visitor access shall be classified into two types as described below:  
 
 Standard  
 Access  granted  to internet  resources  and institutional  resour ces located  
online.  
 Special  
 Access  granted  above  plus any internal  access  as requested  by an individual  
with the authority  to do so: 
o Vice President  for Fiscal  Services,  Vice President  for Academic  Affairs,  President,  or 
other  designee  deemed  necessary  by the President  
 
Internal Access may include:  
 
 Wireless  VLANs  (i.e. cscwireless,  cscguest)  
 Wired  VLANs  (i.e. housing,  guest)  
 Singular  or multiple  file access  
 System  access  such  as Blackboard,  ID Card  System,  etc. 
 
Under  no circumstances  should  visitors  be given  special  access  unless  permission  has been  
obtained from  the appropriate  administrative  personnel  (i.e. a signature  from  one of the personnel  
above)  along with detailed  description  of access.  
 
To obtain  guest/visitor  access  users  should  contact  the CSC  ITS Department  with their requested  
system access  requirements  using  the attached  Authorization  of User  Access  form.  
 
For vendor access, please see the appropriate vendor access policy included herein.  ",Alice Smith
11,Policy,Illegal File Sharing,"Overview  
Legal  compliance  is a primary  focus  at CSC.  Because  of this, we have  set forth  this policy  which 
addresses  illegal  file sharing  legislation,  legal  alternatives  to illegal  file sharing,  and penalties  for violating 
state  and federal  copyright  laws.  
 
This policy  applies  to all CSC  employees,  students,  vendors,  or visitors  utilizing  CSC‐owned  
computers, equipment,  or the CSC  network.  
 
Policy  
File sharing  (peer‐to‐peer)  software  programs  have  led to significant  increases  in anti‐piracy  efforts  
and legislation.  Peer‐to‐peer  software  allows  the sharing  of files often  consisting  of copyrighted  
content such  as music,  movies,  and software  which  usually  occurs  without  the consent  of the 
owner.  
 
It is the policy  of CSC  to respect  copyright  ownership  and protections  given  to authors,  owners, 
publishers,  and creators  of copyrighted  work.  It is against  CSC  policy  for any employee,  student, 
affiliate,  or visitor  to copy,  reproduce,  or distribute  any copyrighted  materials  on CSC‐owned  
equipment or the CSC‐managed  network  unless  expressly  permitted  by the owner  of such  
work.  
 
CSC  also discourages  the use of any file‐sharing  program  as these  types  of programs  may 
allow copyrighted  material  to be downloaded  to a CSC‐owned  computer  or device.  Many  of 
these  programs automatically  place  downloaded  files in a shared  folder  on your computer,  which  
means  you could  be sharing  files without  your knowledge.  This also means  that you may be held 
responsible  for illegal  file sharing,  whether  you are aware  that copyrighted  files are being  
shared  or not. 
 
CSC  also employs  the use of network  appliances,  equipment,  and rules  to limit the amount  of 
file‐ sharing  traffic  on the CSC  network.  Active  blocking  of peer‐to‐peer  traffic  is used  to protect  
the CSC network  from  unwanted  traffic  and the presence  of potentially  malicious  files introduced  
through  file‐ sharing  programs.  
 
CSC  encourages  employees,  students,  affiliates,  and visitors  to utilize  legal  alternatives  to illegal  file 
sharing.  There  are a variety  of free and pay‐per‐use options  available  that can be used  instead  of 
illegal file  sharing  programs.  Several  of these  free and pay‐per‐use options  are listed  below;  
however,  this is in no  way an all‐inclusive  list. CSC  leaves  it to the discretion  of the employee,  student,  
affiliate,  or visitor  to decide  which  alternative  to utilize.  They  are provided  herein  for reference  only 
and CSC  does  not endorse  or provide  any guarantee  or support  for any of the legal  alternatives  
located  below.

12,Policy,Information Sensitivity Policy,"Overview  
Information  sensitivity  is a primary  focus  at CSC.  Since  we are an educational  entity,  we deal  with many 
different  types  of information,  some  for public  use, some  not. To make  these  distinctions,  this document 
will address  both  types  of information.  
 
This policy  is intended  to help  employees  determine  what  information  can be disclosed  to non‐ 
employees,  as well as the relative  sensitivity  of information  that should  not be disclosed  outside  of 
CSC without proper  authorization.  
 
The information  covered  in these  guidelines  includes,  but is not limited  to, information  that is either 
stored  or shared  via any means.  This includes:  electronic  information,  information  on paper,  and 
information  shared  orally  or visually  (such  as via phone  and videoconferencing).  
 
All employees  should  familiarize  themselves  with the information  labeling  and handling  guidelines  that 
follow  this introduction.  It should  be noted  that the sensitivity  level  definitions  were  created  as 
guidelines  and to emphasize  common  sense  steps  that you can take  to protect  confidential  
information (e.g. confidential  information  should  not be left unattended  in conference  rooms.).  
 
NOTE: The impact of these guidelines on daily activity should be minimal.  
 
Questions  about  the proper  classification  of a specific  piece  of information  should  be addressed  to 
your supervisor  or the CSC  ITS Department.  Questions  about  these  guidelines  shoul d be addressed  to 
the CSC ITS Department.  
 
Policy  
By grouping  information  into two different  categories,  we can adequately  address  the needs  of each 
type  of information.  The first type,  public  Information,  is information  that has been  declared  public 
knowledge  by someone  with the authority  to do so, and can freely  be given  to anyone  without  any 
possible  damage  to the institution.  The second  type,  confidential  information  contains  all other 
information.  It is a continuum,  in that it is understood  that some  information  is more  sensitive  than 
other  information,  and should  be protected  in a more  secure  manner.  Included  is information  that 
should  be protected  very closely,  such  as specific  personnel  information,  student  data,  billing 
information,  etc. Also included  in confidential  information  is information  that is less critical,  such  as 
telephone  directories,  personnel  information,  etc., which  does  not require  as stringent  a degree  of 
protection.  
A subset  of the latter  is third‐party  confidential  information.  This is confidential  information  belonging 
or pertaining  to another  corporation  which  has been  entrusted  to CSC  by that company  under  
non‐ disclosure  agreements  and other  contracts.  Examples  of this type  of information  include  
everything from  joint development  efforts  to vendor  lists, customer  orders,  and supplier  information.  
Information in  this category  ranges  from  extremely  sensitive  to information  about  the fact that 
we've  connected  a supplier  / vendor  into CSC's  network  to support  our operations.    
 
CSC  personnel  are encouraged  to use common  sense  judgment  in securing  confidential  information  
to the  proper  extent.  If an employee  is uncertain  of the sensitivity  of a particular  piece  of information, 
he/she  should  contact  their  supervisor  and/or  the CSC  ITS Department  for more  information  and 
instructions  on how this information  should  be handled.  
 
The sensitivity  guidelines  below  provide  details  on how to protect  information  at various  sensitivity 
levels.  Use these  guidelines  as a reference  only,  as CSC  Confidential  Information  at each  level  may 
necessitate  more  or less stringent  measures  of protection  depending  upon  the circumstances  and the 
nature  of the CSC  Confidential  Information  in question.  
 Minimal  Sensitivity  
 
o Description:  General  information,  some  personnel,  and technical  information.  
 
o Access:  CSC  employees,  associates,  or third‐parties  with a business  need  to know.  
 
o Distribution  internal  to CSC:  Approved  electronic  mail and approved  electronic  
file transmission  methods.  
 
o Distribution  external  to CSC:  Approved  electronic  mail and approved  electronic  
file transmission  methods.  
 
o Storage:  When  viewing  data,  do not allow  viewing  by unauthorized  individuals.  Do 
not leave  data  open  and/or  unattended  in any format.  Protect  data  from  loss, 
theft,  or misplacement.  Electronic  information  should  have  individual  access  
controls  where possible and  appropriate.  
 
o Disposal/Destruction:  Electronic  data  should  be permanently  expunged  or 
cleared. Reliably  erase  or physically  destroy  media.  Data  retention  policy  and 
federal  and state retention  guidelines  should  be observed  for original  copies.  
 
 
 More  Sensitive  
 
o Description:  Business,  financial,  technical,  and most  personnel  information.  
 
o Access: CSC employees, associates, or third ‐parties with signed 
non‐disclosure agreements  with a business  need  to know.  
 
o Distribution  internal  to CSC:  Approved  electronic  file transmission  methods.  
 
o Distribution  external  to CSC:  Approved  electronic  file transmission  methods  via a 
private link to approved  recipients  external  to CSC  locations.  
 
o Storage:  Individual  access  controls  are highly  recommended  for more  
sensitive electronic  information.    
 
o Disposal/Destruction:  Electronic  data  should  be permanently  expunged  or 
cleared. Reliably  erase  or physically  destroy  media.  Data  retention  policy  and 
federal  and state retention  guidelines  should  be observed  for original  copies.  
 
 Most  Sensitive  
 
o Description:  Operational,  personnel,  financial,  source  code,  & technical  
information integral  to the security  of the institution.  
 
o Access:  Only  those  individuals  (CSC  employees  and associates)  designated  
with approved  access  and signed  non‐disclosure  agreements.  
 
o Distribution  internal  to CSC:  Approved  electronic  file transmission  methods.  
 
o Distribution  external  to CSC:  Approved  electronic  file transmission  methods  to 
recipients within  CSC.  Strong  encryption  is highly  recommended.  
 
o Storage:  Individual  access  controls  are very highly  recommended  for electronic 
information.  Physical  security  is generally  used,  and information  should  be stored  on 
a physically secured  computer.  
 
o Disposal/Destruct ion: A necessity.  Electronic  data  should  be permanently  
expunged  or cleared.  Reliably  erase  or physically  destroy  media.  Data  retention  
policy  and federal and state  retention  guidelines  should  be observed  for 
original  copies.  ",Charlie Miller
13,Policy,Password Policy,"  
 
Overview  
Passwords  are an important  aspect  of computer  security.  They  are the front  line of protection  for 
user accounts.  A poorly  chosen  password  may result  in the compromise  of DefineX  entire  
network.  As such,  all DefineX  employees  (including  contractors  and vendors  with access  to 
DefineX  systems)  are responsible  for taking  the appropriate  steps,  as outlined  below,  to 
select  and secure  their passwords.  
 
The policy  is applicable  to all personnel  who have  or are responsible  for an account  (or any form  
of access  that supports  or requires  a password)  on any system  that belongs  to CSC,  resides  at 
any DefineX  location,  has access  to the DefineX  network,  or stores  any DefineX  
information.  
Policy  
All passwords will meet the following criteria:  
 
 All system‐level passwords  (e.g.,  root,  admin,  application  administration  accounts)  must  
be changed  at least  every  180 days.  
 All user‐level  passwords  (e.g.,  email,  web,  desktop  computer,  etc.) must  be changed  at 
least every 120  days.  
 User accounts that have system ‐level privileges granted through group 
memberships or programs  such  as ""sudo""  must  have  a unique  password  from  all other  
accounts  held by that user.  
 Passwords  must  NOT be inserted  into email  messages  or other  forms  of 
electronic communication.  
 Where  SNMP  is used,  the community  strings  must  be defined  as something  other  than  the 
standard  defaults  of ""public,""  ""private""  and ""system""  and must  be different  from  the 
passwords used  to log in interactively.  A keyed  hash  must  be used  where  available  
(e.g.,  SNMPv2).  
 All user‐level  and system‐level  passwords  must  conform  to the guidelines  described  
below.  
 
Passwords  are used  for various  purposes  at DefineX . Some  of the more  common  uses  include:  
user level accounts,  web accounts,  email  accounts,  screen  saver  protection,  voicemail  password,  
and local router  logins.  Very few systems  have  proper  support  for one‐time tokens  (i.e., dynamic  
passwords that are only used  once);  therefore,  every  DefineX  employee  should  know  how to 
select  strong passwords.  
 
Poor, weak passwords have the following characteristics:  
 
 The password  contains  less than  eight  characters  
 The password  or a subset  of the password  is a word  found  in a dictionary  (English  or foreign)  
 The password  is a common  usage  word  such  as: 
o Names  of family,  pets,  friends,  co‐workers,  fantasy  characters,  etc.   
 
o Computer  terms  and names,  commands,  sites,  companies,  hardware,  software  
o The words  ""CSC"",  ""connors"",  ""state"",  
  or any derivation  
o Birthdays  and other  personal  information  such  as addresses  and phone  numbers  
o Word  or number  patterns  like aaabbb,  qwerty,  zyxwvuts,  123321,  etc. 
o Any of the above  spelled  backwards  
o Any of the above  preceded  or followed  by a digit  (e.g.,  secret1,  1secret) 
Strong  passwords  have  the following  characteristics:  
 Contain  between  8 and 32 characters  
 Contain  both  upper  and lower  case  characters  (e.g.,  a‐z, A‐Z) 
 Contain  at least  one number  (e.g.,  0‐9) 
 Contain  special  characters  (e.g.,  ~, !, @, #, $, ^, (, ), _, +, =, ‐, ?, or ,) 
 Does  not contain  a dictionary  word  in any language,  slang,  dialect,  jargon,  etc. 
 Does  not contain  personal  information,  names  of family,  etc. 
 
Passwords  should  never  be written  down  or stored  on‐line. Try to create  passwords  that can be 
easily  remembered.  One way to do this is create  a password  based  on a song  title, affirmation,  or 
other  phrase.  For example,  the phrase  might  be: ""This  May Be One Way  To Remember""  and the 
password  could  be: ""TmB1w2R!""  or ""Tmb1W>r~""  or some  other  variation.  
NOTE: Please do not use either of these examples as passwords!  
 
Do not use the same  password  for CSC  accounts  as for other  non‐CSC  access  (e.g.,  personal  
ISP account,  option  trading,  benefits,  etc.).  Do not share  CSC  passwords  with anyone,  including 
administrative  assistants  or secretaries.  All passwords  are to be treated  as sensitive,  confidential 
CSC  information.  
 
Here is a list of ""dont's"":  
 
 Don't  reveal  a password  over  the phone  to ANYONE.  
 Don't  reveal  a password  in an email  message.  
 Don't  reveal  a password  to a supervisor.  
 Don't  talk about  a password  in front  of others.  
 Don't  hint at the format  of a password  (e.g.,  ""my family  name"").  
 Don't  reveal  a password  on questionnaires  or security  forms.  
 Don't  share  a password  with family  members.  
 Don't  reveal  a password  to co‐workers.  
 
  reveal  a password  to vendors.  
 In short,  
  reveal  a password  to ANYONE.  
 Do not use the ""Remember  Password""  feature  of applications  (e.g.,  Eudora,  OutLook,  
Netscape Messenger,  Internet  Explorer,  Firefox,  Thunderbird).  
 Do not write  passwords  down  and store  them  anywhere  in your office.    
 
 Do not store  passwords  in a file on ANY computer  system  (including  Palm  Pilots  or 
similar devices)  without  proper  encryption.  
 Change  passwords  at least  once  every  three  months.  
 
Other items to remember:  
 
 If someone  demands  a password,  refer  them  to this document  or have  them  call the CSC  
ITS Department  to determine  the validity  of their  request.  
 If an account  or password  is suspected  to have  been  compromised,  report  the 
incident  to the CSC  ITS Department  immediately  and change  all passwords  as 
soon  as possible.  
 
Password  cracking  or guessing  may be performed  on a periodic  or random  basis  by the CSC  
ITS Department  or its delegates.  If a password  is guessed  or cracked  during  one of these  scans,  
the user will be required  to change  it. 
 
Never  give your password  out to anyone.  This may or may not include  your supervisor,  a friend  or 
relative,  a student  or part‐time  worker,  or even  a co‐worker.  ",David Garcia
14,Policy,Physical Security Policy," 
 
Overview  
This policy  will establish  physical  security  guidelines  that apply  to all computing  and networking 
equipment  locations.  It is important  to note  that incremental  degrees  of security  will be needed  for 
each area  depending  on the actual  equipment  configuration  and critical  need  to the institution.  
 
Policy  
All areas will be classified into two categories:  
 
• Office  
• Restricted  
 
Office  areas  are simply  that,  office  locations  for CSC  ITS Department  employees.  These  areas  
contain computing  equipment  and other  data  that should  be protected  at all times.  
 
Restricted  areas  are those  areas  that belong  to the CSC  ITS Department  and contain  equipment  
owned and/or  operated  by the CSC  ITS Department  or a third‐party  vendor  (i.e. OneNet)  such  as: 
 Switch  closets  
 Server  rooms  
 Telecommunications  rooms  
 ITS Department  storage  areas  
 
At the time  of this policy,  our current  physical  security  offerings  are somewhat  limited  so more 
advanced  options  cannot  currently  be used.  As upgrades  occur,  recommended  options  will be 
changed to required  options  to increase  and enhance  security.  
 
At minimum, all office and restricted locations require the following security mechanisms:  
 
 Solid  wood  or steel  door  
 Either  keyed  handle  or deadbolt  lock 
 
All CSC  ITS Department  restricted  and office  locations  should  contain  the following  
recommended security  mechanisms:  
 Reinforced  steel  doors  and frames  
 Keyed deadbolt  locks  
 ID card  access  
 Steel  bars  over  windows  ",Eva Smith
15,Policy,Personally Identifiable Information Policy," 
Overview  
This policy  will establish  
  definition  of Personally  Identifiable  Information  (PII) and indicate  
what information  may be shared,  if any, with third‐party  entities.  
 
Policy  
It is important  to note  that information  should  never  be shared  without  cause  or requirement,  
unless dictated  by state  or federal  government  regulations  such  as annual  reporting  guidelines  
and statistical reporting  data,  in the course  of preset  institutional  operations  or vendor  
agreements,  or due to the request  of 
  President  or designee.  
 
PII is the type  of information  that should  be kept  safe using  the highest  level  of security.  PII is 
described as  information  about  an individual  that identifies,  links,  relates,  or is unique  to, or describes  
him or her. This information  may include:  
 Name  
 SSN 
 Address(es)  
 Phone  Number(s)  
 SSN 
 Birth  date  
 Birth  place  
 
  name  
 Family  names  
 Other  family  data  such  as addresses,  contact  information,  etc. 
 Financial  information  such  as bank  account  information,  account  balances,  etc. 
 Other  information  that,  alone  or in combination,  is linked  or linkable  to a specific  student  
that would  allow  a reasonable  person  in the school  community,  who does  not have  a 
personal knowledge  of the relevant  circumstances,  to identify  the student  with a 
reasonable  certainty  
 Information  requested  by a person  who the educational  agency  or institution  believes  
knows the identity  of the student  to whom  the educational  record  directly  relates  
 
Under  no circumstances  should  PII be transported  off‐campus.  On‐campus  storage  of PII should  meet 
other  policy  requirements  as dictated  herein.  Off‐campus  use of this type  of data  may be facilitated  via 
the CSC  ITS 
  Remote  Access  Policy.  ",Frank Brown

necessity.  
 
At present,  this policy  allows  access  to the CSC  wireless  network  via any data  communication  
device containing  the hardware  required  to connect.  Connecting  to the CSC  wireless  network  
does  not grant  a user access  to the internal  networking  infrastructure  or any internal  information  
of CSC, only external  access  to the internet.  Utilizing  
  wireless  network  for access  to the 
internal network  and/or  information  requires  additional  software  that must  be obtained  
through  the CSC ITS Department.  
 
This policy  covers  all wireless  data  communication  devices  (e.g.,  personal  computers,  cellular 
phones,  PDAs,  etc.) connected  to any of CSC's  wireless  networking  access  points.  This includes  any 
form  of wireless  data  communication  device  capable  of transmitting  packet  data.  
 
Policy  
All wireless  data  communication  devices  connected  with 
  wireless  network  will be required  to 
have  current  virus‐scanning  software  installed  with the most  recent  updates  and perform  a full 
system  scan  a minimum  of once  per week.  
 
All wireless  data  communication  devices  connected  with 
  wireless  network  that require  
access to  
  internal  network  and/or  information  will be required  to utilize  specific  software  
and/or access  credentials  obtained  through  the CSC  ITS Department  to do so. 
 
At no time shall  any device  connected  to the CSC  wireless  network  operate  outside  the 
parameters defined  in the Acceptable  Use Policy  provided  herein.  All wirelessly  connected  
devices  may be monitored  and their  information  such  as IP address,  MAC  address,  general  
hardware  profile,  etc. be archived  for future  use. Random  scans  may also be performed  to ensure  
the security  of the wireless networks  and connected  devices  and to obtain  a general  device  
survey  to further  enhance  the accessibility  and usability  of 
  wireless  networks.  ",Alice Davis
21,Procedure,Emergency Operating Procedure," 
In the event  of an emergency,  normal  operating  procedures  should  be restored  as quickly  as

27,Insurance,Introduction,"An insurance policy is a legal contract between an individual or entity and an insurance company. It outlines the terms, conditions, and coverage details of the insurance arrangement.",John Smith
28,Insurance,Policy Types,"Insurance policies come in various types, such as auto insurance, health insurance, property insurance, and liability insurance. Each type offers protection against specific risks.",Emily Thompson
29,Insurance,Policy Structure,"A typical insurance policy includes: policyholder information, policy number, coverage details, premium amount, effective dates, inclusions, exclusions, claims process, and payment instructions.",Michael Johnson
30,Insurance,Filing a Claim,"In the event of a covered loss or damage, policyholders need to file a claim. This involves notifying the insurance company, providing necessary documentation, and cooperating in the claims investigation process.",Sarah White
31,Insurance,Claim Settlement,"Once the claim is reviewed and approved, the insurance company will proceed with the settlement process. This can involve financial compensation, repairs, or replacements as specified in the policy.",David Williams
32,Insurance,Policy Renewal,"Insurance policies typically have expiration dates. To continue coverage, policyholders must renew their policies by paying the premium for the next term. Renewals ensure ongoing protection.",Jessica Brown
33,Insurance,Policy Cancellation,Policyholders may have the option to cancel their policies. Cancellation terms vary and might involve specific procedures. It's important to understand the impact of cancellation on coverage.,William Jones
34,Insurance,Contact Information,"For inquiries, claims, or policy-related questions, policyholders can contact the insurance company's customer service via phone, email, or visiting their website.",Laura Taylor
35,Insurance,Industry standard forms,"In the United States, property and casualty insurers typically use similar or even identical language in their standard insurance policies, which are drafted by advisory organizations such as the Insurance Services Office and the American Association of Insurance Services. This reduces the regulatory burden for insurers as policy forms must be approved by states; it also allows consumers to more readily compare policies, albeit at the expense of consumer choice. In addition, as policy forms are reviewed by courts, the interpretations become more predictable as courts elaborate upon the interpretation of the same clauses in the same policy forms, rather than different policies from different insurers.",James Davis
36,Insurance,Manuscript policies and endorsements,"For the vast majority of insurance policies, the only page that is heavily custom-written to the insured's needs is the declarations page. All other pages are standard forms that refer back to terms defined in the declarations as needed. However, certain types of insurance, such as media insurance, are written as manuscript policies, which are either custom-drafted from scratch or written from a mix of standard and nonstandard forms. By analogy, policy endorsements that are not written on standard forms or whose language is custom-written to fit the insured's particular circumstances are known as manuscript endorsements.",Megan Clark
37,Insurance,Unilateral Contracts,"Insurance contracts are unilateral, meaning that only the insurer makes legally enforceable promises in the contract. The insured is not required to pay the premiums, but the insurer is required to pay the benefits under the contract if the insured has paid the premiums and met certain other basic provisions.",Robert Wilson
38,Insurance,Utmost Good Faith,"Insurance contracts are governed by the principle of utmost good faith (uberrima fides), which requires both parties of the insurance contract to deal in good faith and in particular, imparts on the insured a duty to disclose all material facts that relate to the risk to be covered. This contrasts with the legal doctrine that covers most other types of contracts, caveat emptor (let the buyer beware). In the United States, the insured can sue an insurer in tort for acting in bad faith.",Katie Evans
39,Insurance,Structure,"Insurance contracts were traditionally written on the basis of every single type of risk (where risks were defined extremely narrowly), and a separate premium was calculated and charged for each. Only those individual risks expressly described or 'scheduled' in the policy were covered; hence, those policies are now described as 'individual' or 'schedule' policies. This system of 'named perils' or 'specific perils' coverage proved to be unsustainable in the context of the Second Industrial Revolution, in that a typical large conglomerate might have dozens of types of risks to insure against. For example, in 1926, an insurance industry spokesman noted that a bakery would have to buy a separate policy for each of the following risks: manufacturing operations, elevators, teamsters, product liability, contractual liability (for a spur track connecting the bakery to a nearby railroad), premises liability (for a retail store), and owners' protective liability (for negligence of contractors hired to make any building modifications).",Richard Thomas
40,Insurance,Modern System,"In 1941, the insurance industry began to shift to the current system where covered risks are initially defined broadly in an 'all risk' or 'all sums' insuring agreement on a general policy form (e.g., 'We will pay all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages...'), then narrowed down by subsequent exclusion clauses (e.g., 'This insurance does not apply to...'). If the insured desires coverage for a risk taken out by an exclusion on the standard form, the insured can sometimes pay an additional premium for an endorsement to the policy that overrides the exclusion.",Emma Roberts
41,Insurance,Complexity Concerns,"Insurers have been criticized in some quarters for the development of complex policies with layers of interactions between coverage clauses, conditions, exclusions, and exceptions to exclusions. In a case interpreting one ancestor of the modern 'products-completed operations hazard' clause, the Supreme Court of California complained: 'The instant case presents yet another illustration of the dangers of the present complex structuring of insurance policies. Unfortunately the insurance industry has become addicted to the practice of building into policies one condition or exception upon another in the shape of a linguistic Tower of Babel. We join other courts in decrying a trend which both plunges the insured into a state of uncertainty and burdens the judiciary with the task of resolving it. We reiterate our plea for clarity and simplicity in policies that fulfill so important a public service.'",Joseph Hall
42,Insurance,Integrated Contract,"The insurance policy is generally an integrated contract, meaning that it includes all forms associated with the agreement between the insured and insurer. In some cases, however, supplementary writings such as letters sent after the final agreement can make the insurance policy a non-integrated contract. One insurance textbook states that generally 'courts consider all prior negotiations or agreements ... every contractual term in the policy at the time of delivery, as well as those written afterward as policy riders and endorsements ... with both parties' consent, are part of the written policy'. The textbook also states that the policy must refer to all papers which are part of the policy. Oral agreements are subject to the parol evidence rule, and may not be considered part of the policy if the contract appears to be whole. Advertising materials and circulars are typically not part of a policy. Oral contracts pending the issuance of a written policy can occur.",Amy Lewis
43,Insurance,General Features,"The insurance contract or agreement is a contract whereby the insurer promises to pay benefits to the insured or on their behalf to a third party if certain defined events occur. Subject to the 'fortuity principle', the event must be uncertain. The uncertainty can be either as to when the event will happen (e.g. in a life insurance policy, the time of the insured's death is uncertain) or as to if it will happen at all (e.g. in a fire insurance policy, whether or not a fire will occur at all).",Mark Walker
44,Insurance,Adhesion Contracts,Insurance contracts are generally considered contracts of adhesion because the insurer draws up the contract and the insured has little or no ability to make material changes to it. This is interpreted to mean that the insurer bears the burden if there is any ambiguity in any terms of the contract. Insurance policies are sold without the policyholder even seeing a copy of the contract.,Natalie Green
45,Insurance,Aleatory Contracts,"Insurance contracts are aleatory in that the amounts exchanged by the insured and insurer are unequal and depend upon uncertain future events. In contrast, ordinary non-insurance contracts are commutative in that the amounts (or values) exchanged are usually intended by the parties to be roughly equal. This distinction is particularly important in the context of exotic products such as finite risk insurance that contain 'commutation' provisions.",Steven Martin
46,Insurance,Regulation and Licensing,"Insurance companies are regulated by government authorities to ensure fair practices, financial stability, and consumer protection. They are typically required to obtain licenses and adhere to specific regulations in the jurisdictions where they operate.",Rachel Patel
47,Insurance,Market Competition,"The insurance industry is competitive, with numerous companies vying for market share. Companies differentiate themselves through pricing, coverage options, customer service, and innovative insurance products.",Andrew Allen
48,Insurance,Challenges and Trends,"Insurance companies face challenges such as managing risks from catastrophic events, adapting to changing consumer needs, advancements in technology, and evolving regulatory landscapes. Trends include the use of big data for risk assessment, the rise of insurtech startups, and a focus on sustainable and socially responsible practices.",Hannah King
49,Insurance,Conclusion,"Insurance companies play a crucial role in safeguarding individuals and businesses from financial losses. By providing insurance coverage and managing risks, they contribute to the stability and resilience of economies and communities.",Christopher Wright
50,Insurance,Role and Function,The primary role of insurance companies is to assess risks and offer insurance coverage to mitigate potential financial losses. They collect premiums from policyholders in exchange for providing coverage. Insurance companies invest these premiums to generate returns and maintain financial stability.,Rebecca Foster
51,Insurance,Underwriting Process,"Insurance companies employ underwriters who evaluate applications and assess the risk associated with each potential policyholder. Underwriters determine the terms, conditions, and premium rates based on their risk assessment.",Daniel Baker
52,Insurance,Claims Process,"When a policyholder experiences a covered loss, they can file a claim with the insurance company. The company reviews the claim, assesses the damage, and determines the appropriate compensation or coverage based on the terms of the policy.",Sophie Turner
53,Insurance,Importance of Security,Insurance plays a vital role in providing financial security and peace of mind. It allows individuals and businesses to navigate uncertainties without facing catastrophic financial losses. Insurance contributes to economic stability by reducing the burden of unexpected events.,Matthew Lopez
54,Insurance,Regulation and Oversight,"The insurance industry is regulated by government authorities to ensure fair practices and consumer protection. Regulations require insurance companies to maintain solvency, transparency, and ethical standards in their operations.",Olivia Carter
55,Insurance,Technology and Innovation,"Advancements in technology are transforming the insurance landscape. Digital platforms, data analytics, and artificial intelligence are enhancing underwriting accuracy, claims processing efficiency, and customer interactions.",Nicholas Collins
56,Insurance,Future Outlook,"As society evolves, insurance will continue to adapt to emerging risks and changing customer needs. The industry will likely see increased customization of policies, innovative coverage options, and a stronger focus on sustainability.",Marie Murphy
57,Insurance,Types of Coverage,"Insurance comes in various forms to cater to different needs. Health insurance covers medical expenses, while auto insurance provides coverage for vehicle accidents and damages. Property insurance protects against damage or loss of assets, and life insurance offers financial support to beneficiaries upon the insured's death.",Benjamin Scott
58,Insurance,Risk Sharing,"One of the key principles of insurance is risk sharing. By pooling premiums from numerous policyholders, insurance companies create a fund to cover potential losses. This mechanism spreads the financial impact of unexpected events across a broader group.",Lily Edwards
59,Insurance,Premiums and Claims,"Policyholders pay premiums to maintain their insurance coverage. In return, they are entitled to file claims when covered risks materialize. The insurance company reviews claims, assesses damages, and provides compensation or coverage as outlined in the policy.",Paul Ward
60,Insurance,Financial Protection,"One of the primary benefits of insurance is the financial protection it offers. Health insurance helps cover medical expenses, while life insurance provides financial support to beneficiaries upon the insured's death. Property and casualty insurance protect against property damage, liability claims, and legal costs.",Lisa Perez
61,Insurance,Peace of Mind,"Knowing that they are covered by insurance gives individuals peace of mind. They can navigate life's uncertainties without constantly worrying about the potential financial impact of accidents, illnesses, or other unexpected events.",Adam Mitchell
62,Insurance,Stimulating Economic Activity,Insurance contributes to economic growth by facilitating various transactions. Businesses are more likely to invest and expand when they have insurance coverage to mitigate potential losses. Insurance also supports lending and financing activities by reducing risks for lenders.,Susan Rivera
63,Insurance,Risk Management,"Insurance encourages responsible risk management. Individuals and organizations are motivated to take precautions and preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of accidents or losses, knowing that insurance will provide assistance if needed.",Ryan Harris
64,Insurance,Family and Community Support,"Life insurance provides a safety net for families in times of tragedy. It ensures that dependents have financial support to cover living expenses, education, and other needs. Insurance also contributes to community resilience by helping individuals recover after disasters.",Melanie Price

Knowing that insurance can mitigate potential financial losses, entrepreneurs are more willing to innovate, create jobs, and contribute to economic development.",Brian Cooper
66,Insurance,Adapting to Changing Lifestyles,"Insurance companies adapt their offerings to reflect changing lifestyles and emerging risks. As society evolves, new insurance products address unique needs, such as cyber insurance to protect against digital threats and environmental liability coverage.",Nicole Bell
67,Insurance,Collaboration with Government and Social Services,"Insurance companies often collaborate with governments and social services to enhance safety, disaster preparedness, and community resilience. Public-private partnerships leverage insurance expertise to manage risks at a broader scale.",Stephen Morris
68,Insurance,Auto Insurance,"Auto insurance is essential for drivers as it provides financial protection against physical damage or bodily injury resulting from traffic collisions. Typically, it also covers liabilities arising from such incidents. While every jurisdiction has different requirements, it's generally mandated by law in many places. Premium costs can be influenced by factors like the driver's age, driving history, and type of vehicle. Policies can be canceled if the holder fails to pay the premium, commits insurance fraud, or has too many claims",Emma Roberts
69,Insurance,Life Insurance,"Life insurance ensures that beneficiaries receive a payout upon the insured person's death. This is important for those who have dependents relying on their income. Coverage may vary from term policies, which last for a specified period, to whole-life policies that last a lifetime and can even accumulate cash value. It's critical to assess one's financial needs and choose accordingly. Some reasons policies might be canceled include non-payment or if the insured provides false information during application.",Joseph Hall
70,Insurance,Health Insurance,"Health insurance covers medical expenses ranging from regular check-ups to surgeries. It can be crucial, especially in countries with high healthcare costs. Many employers offer health insurance as a benefit, but individuals can also purchase it independently. Premiums vary based on coverage and individual health risks. Non-payment of premiums or participating in fraudulent claims can result in policy cancellation.",Amy Lewis
71,Insurance,Homeowners Insurance,"This protects homeowners against damages to their home, and to some extent, the belongings inside. It also offers liability coverage if someone gets injured on the property. A homeowner might need this insurance for mortgage requirements or simply for peace of mind. It covers incidents like fires, thefts, and certain natural disasters. However, not all events like earthquakes or floods are typically covered unless added. Cancellation reasons might include non-payment or increased risk factors.",Mark Walker
72,Insurance,Renters Insurance,"Similar to homeowners insurance, renters insurance covers a tenant's personal belongings in the event of damage or theft. Additionally, it provides liability protection. Given that a landlord's insurance doesn't typically cover a tenant's possessions, this insurance is vital for renters. Policy cancellation can arise from non-payment or misrepresentation of claims.",Natalie Green
73,Insurance,Disability Insurance,"Disability insurance provides financial support in case a person becomes unable to work due to an illness or injury. The coverage can be short-term or long-term, depending on the policy's duration. Those with professions that have high injury risks or sole breadwinners might find this insurance particularly useful. Not disclosing existing medical conditions can lead to policy cancellation.",Steven Martin
74,Insurance,Travel Insurance,"Travel insurance is indispensable for frequent travelers. It covers trip cancellations, medical emergencies abroad, and lost baggage. Policies vary, so it's crucial to read the fine print. Before purchasing, consider the destination, duration, and activities planned. Non-disclosure of pre-existing health conditions or participating in very high-risk activities might void the policy.",Rachel Patel
75,Insurance,Pet Insurance,"Pet owners know the potential high costs of veterinary care. Pet insurance helps offset these expenses. The policy might cover accidents, illnesses, and preventive care, depending on the premium. While it's beneficial for all pet owners, those with older pets or breeds prone to health issues should especially consider it. If owners provide incorrect information about their pet's age or health, cancellation might occur.",Andrew Allen
76,Insurance,Business Insurance,"Business insurance is vital to protect companies from various risks like property damage, theft, and legal liability. Depending on the type of business, coverage needs might differ. For instance, a brick-and-mortar store would have different insurance needs compared to an online business. Non-payment, changes in business nature, or excessive claims might result in policy cancellation.",Hannah King
77,Insurance,Crop Insurance,"Farmers rely on this to safeguard against the loss of their crops due to natural disasters or the loss of revenue due to price declines. Agriculture, being highly susceptible to weather changes, needs this security blanket. Policies can be specific to the crop or more general. Like other insurances, non-payment or misrepresentation can lead to termination.",Christopher Wright
